      "title": "Our Story",
      "subtitle": "Equipping believers from every nation to fulfill the Great Commission through biblical training, practical ministry, and global community.",
      "p1": "The Anagkazo Bible & Ministry Training Centre (ABMTC) was founded in 1996 by the Presiding Bishop of the Lighthouse Chapel International Denomination; Bishop Dag Heward-Mills. This was prompted by Bishop Dag's strong desire to see young men and women trained and equipped for the work of the ministry, according to Ephesians 4:11-12. It is the founder's greatest desire that the school would always remain a pastors' training school, without ever evolving into a secular institution whether partly or fully.",
      "p2": "Anagkazo started as a one-year part-time bible school. The first graduation came on in November 1997 with 12 students. It then later evolved into a two-year full-time program.",
      "p3": "Based on the conviction that ministers must have adequate training in different aspects of ministry, a decision was taken during the 2006 academic year to extend the period of training to four years. At this point, the school was called; Christ Missions Academy, later being changed back to Anagkazo Bible & Ministry Training Centre.",
      "p4": "The word 'anagkazo' is the Greek word for compel (Luke 14:23). Our students are trained to compel, necessitate, entreat and constrain the unsaved to enter into the kingdom of God.",
      "p5": "The first batch of 45 students for the four-year program graduated in November 2008. In November 2009, another batch of 67 students were graduated from the institution. Over the years, Anagkazo Bible School, which is now well recognized has become an international ground for pastoral and missionary training.",
      "p6": "Currently, Anagkazo has over 800 full-time residential students. After much fine-tuning, the full scope of training offered by the school currently spans three years.",
      "p7": "Our students come from Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, and more. Graduates of Anagkazo are known for their soul-winning and church-planting passion, and have a strong desire to see the gospel preached to every soul everywhere! Their life's aim is to see every soul 'anagkazoed' into the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "p8": "Coming to Anagkazo would definitely help you to nurture and fulfil God's calling upon your life."
